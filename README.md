### Balls! (yap session) 12-17-25

Hello there, This repo contains a Terminal User Interface(TUI) Productivity Program Application (at the time of writing only the todo list is "operational" but still in development) written in C. The development of this passion project of mine stemmed from my lack of patience in learning already existing an well established productivity apps and my desire in learning and "mastering" a really low level language like C. My initial thought in using C for this was that since C is like the big daddy of many modern programming languages and operating systems like LINUX and WINDOWS is made out of pure C; if I mastered this programming lanugage I would have been the MASTER of ALL the programming languages (I have yet to get deep into other programming languages so Idk if this holds true... it prolly isn't).

External libraries such as ncurses for the TUI and Cjson for storing data have been used for this project. Using ncurses has been a pain in my assholes because all it can do is write to specific coordinates of the terminal and does not contain some sort of "structure" for complex UI work like textboxes, almost everything had to be rendered manually which took up a lot of time and effort.

Using C had really taught me how to think from the ground up, by using the basic building blocks its provides to design my own way of implementing and storing things in my code. For example in storing todo items my first thought was using an array, but this approach was not appealing to me because 1. Arrays in C are fixed in size so I would have to allocate a large chunk of memory which wont be used until I put things and I don't like the idea of wasting memory and 2. ...I didn't know you could make dynamic arrays by reallocating memory into a bigger chunk and transfering the items 😭😭😭. Therefore I decided to use **Linked Lists** to store my todo items which turned out to be a very mcuh more complicated than I thought. 

Linked lists in theory seemed simple but the actual implementation got a bit too freaky because this time was using pointers and like in linked lists are simple in theory but complicated during actual implementation and practicing these concepts at the same time turned out to be difficult. Not for long though I quickly got the hang of it and realized that I can just encapsulate the resuling code into functions to make things simpler for me, using functions also mitigates risks like losing the pointers and memory leaks since by making sure most of the pointer manipulation happen in specific functions, I know what blocks of code to fix in case of segment faults and memory leaks. But as I continue to add more features like TodoGroups and Pages and performing operations on specific nodes on that list, I began regretting using linked list for this because you cannot access a node in the middle of the list without accessing the head node, I was contemplating switching to dynamic array but at this point a big part of my program was already designed to use linked lists and switching would mean refactoring/rewritting most of my code which was not possible for me at the time so I just decided to continue with linked lists. 

I managed to make it work and on late November 2025 I managed to finish a prototype of this project and was able to use it as an independent program, by then I have learned a lot about low level programming concepts like how to manage memory by allocating and free as well as experiencing the many Segfaults that come with learning to manually manage memory and pointers. I can also say that I *understand* pointers now (50/50). In the beginning I was did not care about writing "good" code and making things understandable because in my mind only I would read and write my code. As my code got bigger I had trouble keeping up with what I wrote and learned the importance of writing readable code which lead to me doing a lot of refactoring and finally using comments to make my code easier for me to bear, through this I also learned about the importance of system design because a projects poor inital design patters will reflect later on because as it gets bigger its gets more difficult to continue working on. 

This is the first large project that I continually worked on for **Months** starting on August until late November where I got the first self sustaining instance of the program running, what motivated me to push through with developing this even though I had school and life stuff going on was that I had trouble keeping track of everything and so every time I would think of organizing things my mind would go to finishing this project. When I did finish it I would say my productivity skyrocked and each new feature I add only adds to that.
